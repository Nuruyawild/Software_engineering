# I
In order to run Tomeo. you must first ensure that the system environment and software configuration:
We use Windows 10 + Qt creator 4.11.0(based on Qt 5.14.0 (MSVC) as the development platform, Desktop Qt 5.9.9 MinGW 32bit as a build suite for Qt, all tests and video evidence are based on this development platform.
To run Tomeo, you should download the zip file for the project, open the folder “the”, and open the.pro in Qt creator. The compressed file that we uploaded does not contain the video that required to show the Tomeo’s video play function, so you need to set the absolute path that you prefered to display the video function in the project option on the left side (don't forget double quote).

# II
To ensure the availability of the code in each ZIP file, we tested it locally before uploading. Therefore, if you want to run code on GitHub, you may need to delete the folder named build-the-desktop_qt_5_9_9_mingw_32bit-debug and the.user file in the folder before performing the action in part I. If you are unable to run, please contact us immediately. However, I recommend you to run the latest version of each cycle (the number after cycle in the name of each file represents the number of versions, and no number represents the initial version. E.g. “TomeoDevCycle3-v4.zip” represents that this is the fourth version of cycle 3, “TomeoDevCycle3.rar” represents that this is the initial version of cycle 3)
